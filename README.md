## Overview

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center"><img src="docs/assets/images/overview_v5.png" width=800 /></div>
A foundation model, based on a deep convolutional encoder architecture, was pre-trained by contrasting volumes with and without lesions (see <b>a.</b> in Figure). The foundation model was then used to extract biomarkers and evaluated for three classification tasks on diverse datasets. (see <b>b.</b>). We adapted foundation model to specific use cases by extracting features or through fine-tuning (see <b>c.</b>). Performance of the foundation models was compared against conventional supervised implementations, trained from scratch (left) and fine-tuned from a different task (right) (in <b>d</b>). The comparison was made through several criteria for different use cases, including quantitative performance, stability, and biological analysis. Biological, clinical, and stability analyses are limited to use case 2 due to the availability of associated data.

## Quick Start (in under 15 mins!)
We provide two notebooks that can be run in google colab to promote the use of our model by the community,

1. A reproducibility notebook that allows users to recreate our analysis for NSCLC prognostication, from downloading the data to obtaining results matching our manuscript. <br><center>

2. A bring your own use case notebook that shows you how you can use the foundation model for your data. <br> <center>

<b>You are not limited to using Colab and you can run our model on your data locally in only 3 steps!</b>

<u>Step 1:</u> Install all our dependencies:
```bash
pip install foundation-cancer-image-biomarker --pre
```

<u>Step 2:</u>  Generate a CSV file with the path to your images and seed points (in physical coordinates),

| **image_path**               | **coordX** | **coordY** | **coordZ** |
|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| /content/data/dummy_0.nii.gz | 55.0       | 119.0      | 27.0       |

<u>Step 3:</u>  Run this in your code environment,
```python
from fmcib.run import get_features

feature_df = get_features("csv_path_here")
```

This will preprocess your data, download our pre-trained model and execute inference on whatever device you have (CPU/GPU) and return a dataframe with the features.
