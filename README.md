 <b>General overview of the study.</b><b> a. Foundation model pre-training.</b> A foundation model, specifically a deep convolutional encoder model, was pre-trained by contrasting volumes with and without lesions. <b> b. </b> Clinical application of the foundation model. The foundation model was used to extract biomarkers and then evaluated for three classification tasks on diverse datasets. <b>c. Foundation model implementation approaches </b>  The foundation model was adapted to specific use cases by extracting features or through fine-tuning (left). <b> d. Evaluation against supervised models with selected performance metrics. </b> We compared the performance of the foundation models against conventional supervised implementations, trained from scratch (left) and fine-tuned from a different task (right). The comparison was made through several criteria for the different use cases, including quantitative performance, stability, and biological analysis. Biological, clinical, and stability analyses are limited to use case 2 due to the availability of associated data.

## Quick Start
The easiest way to use this repository is by installing it through `pip`. This will load all the dependencies and allow you to load model weights dynamically.

```bash
pip install foundation-image-biomarker
```

Once you do this, you can look run each of our described pipelines
